# Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)
A Fiber Optic Gyroscope is a type of gyroscope that uses light and fiber optics to measure angular velocity. It operates on the principle of the Sagnac effect, which states that when light travels in opposite directions around a rotating loop, the time taken by the two beams will differ based on the rotational motion of the loop.
## Key Features
- **High Precision**: FOGs provide very accurate measurements of rotation, making them ideal for navigation systems in aircraft, ships, and spacecraft.
- **Lightweight**: They are typically smaller and lighter than traditional mechanical gyroscopes.
- **Robustness**: FOGs have no moving parts, which increases their durability and reduces maintenance needs.
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Used in aerospace, automotive, robotics, and consumer electronics.
## How It Works
1. **Light Source**: A coherent light source (usually a laser) emits light into a fiber optic coil.
2. **Splitting and Traveling**: The light is split into two beams that travel in opposite directions around the coil.
3. **Interference**: When the beams meet again after traveling around the coil, they create an interference pattern that changes based on the rotation rate.
4. **Measurement**: The phase shift between the two beams is measured to determine the angular velocity.
FOGs are increasingly popular in modern inertial navigation systems due to their accuracy and reliability.
